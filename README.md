# naviList

naviList is a self-hosted playlist manager and generator for [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/). It runs alongside Navidrome and extends it with rule-based playlist generation, external service integration, and intelligent library tooling — all without touching your music files.

---

## What it does

### Playlist generation
- **naviList playlists** — rules-based generation using stats, tags, artists, decades, and more. Rules are weighted and interleaved, not concatenated. Supports auto-refresh on a cron schedule.
- **Radio playlists** — seed one or more artists and naviList finds similar music from your library using cached Last.fm similarity data. Adjustable depth (close / medium / wide).
- **Navidrome Smart Playlists (NSP)** — a UI wrapper for Navidrome's native `.nsp` smart playlist format. Build conditions visually, naviList writes the file and Navidrome evaluates it live.
- **Manual playlists** — browse your library and build playlists by hand.

### External service integration
- **Last.fm** — syncs listen history, loved tracks, top artists, top tracks, artist tags, similar artists, and chart-based playlists (weekly, monthly, all-time). Subscribe to auto-updating playlists or save point-in-time snapshots.
- **ListenBrainz** — syncs listen history, loved tracks, top artists, top tracks, and generated playlists (Weekly Jams, Weekly Exploration, Daily Jams). Same subscribe/snapshot model as Last.fm.
- **Lidarr** — when a subscribed playlist contains artists not in your library, naviList can automatically queue them in Lidarr for download. Configurable as always-on or manually triggered.

### Library tooling
- Syncs your full Navidrome library into a local SQLite database for fast, offline querying.
- Artist images fetched from Deezer at sync time and served locally.
- Folder-level sync filtering — restrict syncs to specific Navidrome music folders.

---

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A running Navidrome instance
- Navidrome's `PlaylistsPath` configured and mounted (required for NSP playlists)

---

## Quick start

### 1. docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  navilist:
    image: ghcr.io/your-username/navilist:latest
    container_name: navilist
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data          # SQLite DB and artist images
      - ./nsp:/nsp                # NSP playlist output — must match Navidrome's PlaylistsPath
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-qO-", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
```

### 2. Environment variables

All service credentials can be set via environment variables as seed values on first boot. If a setting has already been saved through the UI, the environment variable is ignored — UI-saved values always take precedence.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port naviList listens on |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `DB_PATH` | `/app/data/navilist.db` | Path to the SQLite database file |
| `NAVIDROME_URL` | — | Navidrome base URL e.g. `http://navidrome:4533` |
| `NAVIDROME_USER` | — | Navidrome username |
| `NAVIDROME_PASSWORD` | — | Navidrome password |
| `MUSIC_FOLDER_IDS` | — | Comma-separated Navidrome music folder IDs to restrict sync to |
| `LASTFM_API_KEY` | — | Last.fm API key |
| `LASTFM_USERNAME` | — | Last.fm username |
| `LISTENBRAINZ_TOKEN` | — | ListenBrainz user token |
| `LISTENBRAINZ_USERNAME` | — | ListenBrainz username |
| `LIDARR_URL` | — | Lidarr base URL e.g. `http://lidarr:8686` |
| `LIDARR_API_KEY` | — | Lidarr API key |
| `LIDARR_ROOT_FOLDER` | — | Lidarr root folder path e.g. `/music` |
| `LIDARR_QUALITY_PROFILE_ID` | — | Lidarr quality profile ID |
| `LIDARR_METADATA_PROFILE_ID` | — | Lidarr metadata profile ID |
| `NL_NSP_PATH` | — | Path inside the container where `.nsp` files are written |

### 3. Navidrome configuration

For NSP playlists to work, Navidrome must be pointed at the same directory naviList writes `.nsp` files to. In your Navidrome config:

```toml
PlaylistsPath = /music/playlists
```

Mount the same path in both containers so they share the directory.

Example combined compose:

```yaml
services:
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    volumes:
      - ./music:/music:ro
      - ./nsp:/music/playlists
    environment:
      - ND_PLAYLISTSPATH=/music/playlists

  navilist:
    image: ghcr.io/your-username/navilist:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./nsp:/nsp
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-qO-", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    depends_on:
      - navidrome
```

In naviList Settings, set the NSP output path to `/nsp`.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/navilist.git
cd navilist
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs with `nodemon` — restarts automatically on file changes. Server starts on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

```bash
npm start
```

### Docker build

```bash
docker build -t navilist .
```

---

## First run

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` — you'll land on the Playlists page.
2. Go to **Settings** and configure Navidrome credentials. Hit **Test Connection**.
3. Go to **Services** and hit **Sync Library** to pull your Navidrome library into naviList's local database.
4. Optionally configure Last.fm, ListenBrainz, and Lidarr in Settings.
5. Go to **Services** and run **Sync All** for any connected services.
6. Create your first playlist from the Playlists page.

After initial setup, naviList polls Navidrome for library changes every 5 minutes and runs a full external service sync every 30 minutes automatically.
